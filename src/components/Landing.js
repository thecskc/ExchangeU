                            <p>
                            Overall I found my Exchange experience very helpful and
                            encouraging. My coach was excellent, he identified my strengths
                            and weaknesses correctly. He also suggested hints during the
                            interview which steered me in the right direction. The problems
                            were also well chosen to determine my skill level. I would
                            recommend him to others and I got a lot out of just one session.

                                I would give my coach a 4.75/5. He was very good at making sure
                                each interview was scheduled according to my needs, and I felt
                                much more confident in my interview. In the short amount of time
                                we had, we were able to work through a good amount of problems,
                                and he chose the ones that exercised my abilities for thinking
                                problems through. I would use Exchange again, and I would
                                definitely recommend it to a friend.

                                My coach was very attentive to what I needed. I really needed some
                                extra resources to prepare for my upcoming interviews, so I
                                contacted Exchange for more info. The founders of Exchange
                                connected me with a Google coach, which was pretty awesome because
                                he prepared me more thoroughly than my friends, clubs, or
                                interview prep books did. I felt very confident going into my
                                phone interviews and I'm certain I moved onto the next round. For
                                me, using Exchange was all about increasing my chances and
                                Exchange helped alot with that.

                                Leetcode problems much better than I was able to before.

                                My 3 sessions with my technical interview coach Kim were great! We
                                talked about Uber and his role there and how he prepared for his
                                interview. He was able to understand that I lagged in topics like
                                DP and Graphs. So we spent a lot of time working on those areas.
                                Now, I feel confident about my onsite interview in two weeks!
